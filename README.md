# GBBP Developement Hub Prototype Website

## Overview

Prototype of the Government Business Blockchain Platform Website. It would be a website for those developing and working with blockchain technologies within, or associated with, the [Government Blockchain Association](https://www.gbaglobal.org/gbbp/). This project just contains a basic layout of what the website would look like, so most of the info listed is filler text, images are filler as well, and, unless stated, links will go nowhere. The website contains a [Home](###-home-page) page and a [Platform Start Guide](###-platform-start-guide) page. This project incorporated HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project gave me experience with web developement, web design, Visual Studio Code, tables, dropdown menus, forms, pop-ups, animation, and git. The website can be viewed [here](https://solstice-clumsy-stool.glitch.me/mainGBBP.html).

## Features:

### Header and Footer

Both pages contain a header and footer.
The header (going left to right) contains a link to the home page, as well as the name of the page the user is on if they aren't on the home page. There is a dropdown menu on the right that users could use to navigate to different pages on the website.

The footer contains resource links for the user. There is a row for communitcation with the site admins, called "Contact Us" which includes a link to "[Report an Issue](####-report-an-issue-form)" and a link to "Ask a Question". The second row is for "Privacy and Compliance", where the privacy policy and terms and conditions would be found. Finally, the last row lists the site's copyright status.

#### Report an Issue Form

This is a pop up form that opens when clicking on the "Report an Issue" link in the [footer](###-header-and-footer). This form requires a name and email, and allows the user to select their issue(s) from the checklist and leave a description of the problem. The form comes with buttons to clear the description area, cancel the report, or submit the form, as well as a button at the top of the form, in the shape of an "X", to exit. Clicking the "X", "Cancel Report", or clicking anywhere outside the area of the form will exit out of the form and clear all information. After submitting, a user will get a notice that confirms the form was recieved from a small pop up that uses animation to appear on screen. That can also be dismissed with an "X" in the corner.

### Home Page

The home page of the website is titled the "GBBP Developer Hub". It contains a [header and footer](###-header-and-footer), links to other pages on the website, general information about the GBBP, and contact information for site admins. Among the links to other pages on the website is a link to the [Platform Start Guide](###-platform-start-guide) page.

### Platform Start Guide

The Platform Start Guide contains a [header and footer](###-header-and-footer), more specific information for users to understand how to utilize the website, and an imbedded video with a description.
